# hk_aliases folder
This folder contains files which are run once, when the hero's binds are selected.

This would allow you to set commands to modify the game's behaviour, such as
the health bar segments, which would be useful for heroes with nukes, or other
game settings that only need to be changed once at the start of each game with
this hero.
